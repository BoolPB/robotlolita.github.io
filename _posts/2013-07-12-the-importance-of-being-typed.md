Logic-less HTML templating engines are quite the buzz these days, for they allow the programmer to specify their HTML declaratively, forces them to separate logic from presentation, and saves them from all the problems that could happen when naïvely concatenating Strings for The Great Good™... or do they?

There are a myriad of problems with the approach that popular templating engines, such as [Handlebars][] or [M(o)ustache][Mustache] take when it comes down to handling structured formats like HTML, and most of them comes from the use of: naïvely concatenating Strings! Sounds insane?! Smells like bullshit?! Well, stick with me!
