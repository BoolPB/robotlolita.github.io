Albeit being one of the most *fuzzy* concepts in computer science, **Object Orientation** is fairly pervasive. Of all the different school of thoughts on this field, the **classical** object orientation is the most mainstream, and widely known. However, different forms of object orientation, like **prototypical** or **generic** exists, and are meant to solve outstanding problems with the classic formulation.

In this article, we focus on prototypical object orientation, a philosophy where objects inherit directly from other objects, which is *arguably* more "object oriented" than other formulations. To do so, we use the [Io](http://iolanguage.org/) programming language, a minimal, object oriented, prototypical language with multiple-delegation. It is not necessary to know **Io** to read this paper, as the syntax and concepts are explained thoroughly.
