        <h2>Who <span>is this guy?</span></h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Quildreen Motta</strong>. I'm
            a <strong>minimalist designer</strong> and
            <strong>front-end developer</strong> based in Belo
            Horizonte, Brazil. I
            love <em>technology</em>, <em>inovation</em>
            and <em>web-standards</em>.</p>
        
        <p>I also can't live without the open source community, my daily
            caffeinne, neo-victorian fashion (and lolita, mori kei, decora...), art
            and good music.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>What <span>does he do?</span></h2>
        <p>I project web sites and web apps. I really like
            developing web apps better, since they're so fun to work
            with!</p> 
        
        <p>Currently I'm writing an <a href="/orpheos">OS in JavaScript</a>,
            to run on top of Node.js and Webkit-based
            browsers :3</p>
    <li>
        <h2>How <span>does he do that?</span></h2>
        <p>I start with gathering the requirements for the problem in hands,
            brainstorming possible abstract solutions and tools I might use. Then I
            move on to work out those bullet points focusing on the design goals
            and the user experience.</p>
        
        <p>For my development I use tools like
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>,
            <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>,
            <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>
            with <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/">Enlightenment (e17)</a>
            and such.</p>
