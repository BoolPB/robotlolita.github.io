## Major projects

### [Hi-Five](https://github.com/hifivejs/hifive)

A minimal, simple and extensible BDD library. The goal of Hi-Five is to
provide a simple framework for writing tests that can be ran in any
platform (and Continuous-Integration service) that understands JavaScript.

Current platforms include Node and all Browser environments, and it can
be easily integrated with Travis-CI and Testling CI.


### [Claire](https://github.com/killdream/claire)

A property-based (generative) testing library that can generate test
cases for you. It's highly influenced by both Haskell's QuickCheck
and Scala's ScalaCheck, while being designed to work with JavaScript's
rules and semantics.

Planned features include shrinking and random-program generation.



## Language primitives

### [Boo](https://github.com/killdream/boo)

A library that provides better prototypical object orientation
primitives for JavaScript, including `clone`, `extend` and `merge`.


### [Athena](https://github.com/killdream/athena)

A library that provides common functional primitives missing in
the JavaScript language, like `curry`, `partial`, etc.


### [Polygamous](https://github.com/killdream/polygamous)

A library that implements Clojure-style multi-methods in
JavaScript. Clojure's multi-methods use a limited form of
predicate dispatching.


### [Shoutout](https://github.com/killdream/shoutout)

A library that implements simple and type-safe events in JavaScript.


### [Futurism](https://github.com/killdream/futurism)

A library that implements fast monadic promises conforming to the
Fantasy-Land specifications.


### [Lazysex](https://github.com/killdream/lazysex)

A library that implements monadic lazy streams for JavaScript,
influenced by both Haskell and Scala.



## Node utilities

### [FFS](https://github.com/killdream/ffs)

A higher-level file system library that uses promises for asynchronous operations.


### [Noisyo](https://github.com/killdream/noisyo)

A library for making the work of reading from and writing to streams asynchronously easier.


### [Seashell](https://github.com/killdream/seashell)

An Domain-Specific Embedded Language for dealing with executing and composing shell processes.



## DOM utilities

### [Dominatrix](https://github.com/killdream/dominatrix)

A structured templating library for HTML in the Browser, using proper DOM objects.


### [Domina](https://github.com/killdream/domina)

A functional library for making the task of manipulating collections of DOM elements simpler.
